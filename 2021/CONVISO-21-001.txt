[CONVISO-21-001] - [CONVISO-21-001] - October CMS Token Reactivation

1. Advisory Information
    Conviso Advisory ID: CONVISO-21-001
    CVE ID: CVE-2021-3311 
    CVSS v3: 8.1,  (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
    Date: 2021-01-26

2. Affected Components
    October CMS >= v1.0.471

3. Description
    After logout on the application, the user token was invalidated, but with a new login, the old
    token is validated again. So the flux is basically:

        1. Victim logs in
        2. Attacker captures victim’s session cookie
        3. Victim logs out
        4. Session cookie no longer works
        5. Victim logs in a second time
        6. ORIGINAL session cookie works (Attacker is also signed in)

4. Details
    October CMS is based on Laravel architecture, looking at the logout application, it was noticed
    that the Session::flush() method was been used. That method doesn't invalidate the old token
    properly, it only erases it without destroying it.

5. Solution
    Instead of using the flush method, use the migrate method. Those two methods serve the same
    purpose but invalidate method calls migrate that is responsible to invalidate the token.
